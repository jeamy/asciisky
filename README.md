# ASCII Sky - Celestial Tracker

A web application that displays the current positions of celestial bodies (Sun, Moon, planets) in ASCII art, specifically for Vienna, Austria.

## Features

- Real-time tracking of celestial bodies (altitude and azimuth)
- Display of objects above and below the horizon
- Current moon phase visualization
- Rise, set, and transit times for all celestial objects
- Interactive object selection with detailed information dialog
- Distance and magnitude information for all objects
- Auto-updates every 30 seconds
- Responsive design
- Internationalization (i18n) with German as default language
- Minimalist UI design with optimized space usage

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose

## Running the Application

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash

This project uses Skyfield for astronomical calculations.

Skyfield: High precision research-grade positions for planets and Earth satellites generator
Rhodes, Brandon
Skyfield computes positions for the stars, planets, and satellites in orbit around the Earth. Its results should agree with the positions generated by the United States Naval Observatory and their Astronomical Almanac to within 0.0005 arcseconds (which equals half a "mas" or milliarcsecond). It computes geocentric coordinates or topocentric coordinates specific to your location on the Earth's surface. Skyfield accepts AstroPy (ascl:1304.002) time objects as input and can return results in native AstroPy units but is not dependend on AstroPy nor its compiled libraries.
